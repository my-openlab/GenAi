To create a Python module that produces embeddings from audio input using the specifications you've provided, we can utilize the librosa library for audio processing. This library offers robust tools for audio analysis, including the extraction of log-Mel spectrograms, which we can use to compute the 32-dimensional features from the audio.

First, you need to make sure you have librosa and numpy installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

bash

pip install librosa numpy

Here's a Python script that defines a module to transform audio input into the desired embeddings:

```python

import numpy as np
import librosa

def audio_to_embedding(audio, sr=16000):
    """
    Converts a batch of audio samples into 32-dimensional log-mel spectrogram features.

    Parameters:
    - audio : np.ndarray
        A numpy array of shape (batch_size, num_samples) containing the audio samples.
        Each sample should be a 32-bit float between -1 and 1.
    - sr : int, optional
        The sample rate of the audio (default is 16000 Hz).

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray
        A numpy array containing the log-mel spectrogram features of shape (batch_size, time_steps, 32).
    """
    # Validate inputs
    assert sr == 16000, "Sample rate must be 16kHz"
    
    # Constants for the STFT and Mel transformation
    n_fft = int(0.025 * sr)  # 25ms window size
    hop_length = int(0.010 * sr)  # 10ms step size
    fmin = 60  # minimum frequency for mel scale
    fmax = 3800  # maximum frequency for mel scale
    n_mels = 32  # number of mel frequency bins

    # Initialize list to store the log-mel features
    features = []

    # Process each sample in the batch
    for sample in audio:
        # Compute the magnitude spectrogram from the audio
        S = np.abs(librosa.stft(sample, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length))
        
        # Convert to mel scale
        mel_filter = librosa.filters.mel(sr, n_fft, n_mels=n_mels, fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax)
        mel_spec = np.dot(mel_filter, S**2)
        
        # Compute the logarithm of the mel spectrogram
        log_mel_spec = librosa.power_to_db(mel_spec)
        
        # Append to features
        features.append(log_mel_spec.T)  # transpose to have shape (time_steps, 32)

    return np.array(features)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate a dummy audio batch (2 samples, each 1 second long)
    batch_size = 2
    duration = 1  # in seconds
    num_samples = sr * duration
    audio = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (batch_size, num_samples)).astype(np.float32)

    embeddings = audio_to_embedding(audio)
    print("Shape of embeddings:", embeddings.shape)
    print("Embeddings data example (first batch element):", embeddings[0])
```
This script assumes that:

    The audio input is a 2D NumPy array where each row represents an audio sample.
    The samples are appropriately normalized to the range of -1 to 1.
    The librosa library functions are used for STFT calculation, Mel filter bank construction, and conversion to log-Mel spectrograms.

The example usage at the end of the script demonstrates how to use this function with dummy data. Adjust the batch size and duration as needed for your specific application.

adapt the code to record 1.98seconds audio from microphone and use it to create the embedding above

ChatGPT

To capture audio from the microphone, we'll integrate the sounddevice library, which provides a straightforward interface to record audio. We'll modify the previous script to record 1.98 seconds of audio and then process it to extract the desired 32-dimensional log-mel features.

First, ensure that you have the sounddevice library installed, which you can do using pip:

```bash

pip install sounddevice

Here is the adapted Python code:

python

import numpy as np
import librosa
import sounddevice as sd

def record_audio(duration, sr=16000):
    """
    Records audio from the default microphone for the specified duration at the given sample rate.

    Parameters:
    - duration : float
        Duration of the recording in seconds.
    - sr : int, optional
        Sample rate of the recording (default is 16000 Hz).

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray
        Recorded audio as a numpy array.
    """
    recording = sd.rec(int(duration * sr), samplerate=sr, channels=1, dtype='float32')
    sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished
    return recording.flatten()  # Return as a 1D array

def audio_to_embedding(audio, sr=16000):
    """
    Converts audio samples into 32-dimensional log-mel spectrogram features.

    Parameters:
    - audio : np.ndarray
        A numpy array containing the audio sample.
        Each sample should be a 32-bit float between -1 and 1.
    - sr : int, optional
        The sample rate of the audio (default is 16000 Hz).

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray
        A numpy array containing the log-mel spectrogram features of shape (time_steps, 32).
    """
    # Constants for the STFT and Mel transformation
    n_fft = int(0.025 * sr)  # 25ms window size
    hop_length = int(0.010 * sr)  # 10ms step size
    fmin = 60  # minimum frequency for mel scale
    fmax = 3800  # maximum frequency for mel scale
    n_mels = 32  # number of mel frequency bins

    # Compute the magnitude spectrogram from the audio
    S = np.abs(librosa.stft(audio, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length))
    
    # Convert to mel scale
    mel_filter = librosa.filters.mel(sr, n_fft, n_mels=n_mels, fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax)
    mel_spec = np.dot(mel_filter, S**2)
    
    # Compute the logarithm of the mel spectrogram
    log_mel_spec = librosa.power_to_db(mel_spec)
    
    return log_mel_spec.T  # transpose to have shape (time_steps, 32)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Record 1.98 seconds of audio
    duration = 1.98
    sr = 16000
    audio = record_audio(duration, sr)
    embeddings = audio_to_embedding(audio, sr)
    print("Shape of embeddings:", embeddings.shape)
    print("Embeddings data example:", embeddings)
```

This script consists of two main functions:

    record_audio: Captures audio from the microphone for a specified duration and sample rate.
    audio_to_embedding: Transforms the recorded audio into 32-dimensional log-mel spectrogram features.

The example usage at the end of the script demonstrates recording 1.98 seconds of audio and computing its embedding. Note that running this script will require permission to access the microphone, and it should be run in an environment that can interact with your audio hardware (e.g., not in some online IDEs).

also plot me the log_mel_spec after it has been calculated 

ChatGPT

To plot the log-Mel spectrogram after it has been calculated, you will need the matplotlib library for creating visualizations in Python. If you don't have it installed already, you can install it using pip:

```bash

pip install matplotlib

Now, letâ€™s modify the previous script to include plotting the log-Mel spectrogram using matplotlib. Here is the full updated Python script:

python

import numpy as np
import librosa
import sounddevice as sd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def record_audio(duration, sr=16000):
    """
    Records audio from the default microphone for the specified duration at the given sample rate.

    Parameters:
    - duration : float
        Duration of the recording in seconds.
    - sr : int, optional
        Sample rate of the recording (default is 16000 Hz).

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray
        Recorded audio as a numpy array.
    """
    recording = sd.rec(int(duration * sr), samplerate=sr, channels=1, dtype='float32')
    sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished
    return recording.flatten()  # Return as a 1D array

def audio_to_embedding(audio, sr=16000, plot=False):
    """
    Converts audio samples into 32-dimensional log-mel spectrogram features and optionally plots the spectrogram.

    Parameters:
    - audio : np.ndarray
        A numpy array containing the audio sample.
        Each sample should be a 32-bit float between -1 and 1.
    - sr : int, optional
        The sample rate of the audio (default is 16000 Hz).
    - plot : bool, optional
        Whether to plot the log-mel spectrogram (default is False).

    Returns:
    - np.ndarray
        A numpy array containing the log-mel spectrogram features of shape (time_steps, 32).
    """
    # Constants for the STFT and Mel transformation
    n_fft = int(0.025 * sr)  # 25ms window size
    hop_length = int(0.010 * sr)  # 10ms step size
    fmin = 60  # minimum frequency for mel scale
    fmax = 3800  # maximum frequency for mel scale
    n_mels = 32  # number of mel frequency bins

    # Compute the magnitude spectrogram from the audio
    S = np.abs(librosa.stft(audio, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length))
    
    # Convert to mel scale
    mel_filter = librosa.filters.mel(sr, n_fft, n_mels=n_mels, fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax)
    mel_spec = np.dot(mel_filter, S**2)
    
    # Compute the logarithm of the mel spectrogram
    log_mel_spec = librosa.power_to_db(mel_spec)
    
    if plot:
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
        librosa.display.specshow(log_mel_spec, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time', y_axis='mel', fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax)
        plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
        plt.title('Log-Mel Spectrogram')
        plt.show()
    
    return log_mel_spec.T  # transpose to have shape (time_steps, 32)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Record 1.98 seconds of audio
    duration = 1.98
    sr = 16000
    audio = record_audio(duration, sr)
    embeddings = audio_to_embedding(audio, sr, plot=True)
    print("Shape of embeddings:", embeddings.shape)
    print("Embeddings data example:", embeddings)
```

In this script:

    I added a plot parameter to the audio_to_embedding function. If plot is True, the function plots the log-Mel spectrogram using matplotlib.
    The librosa.display.specshow function is used for displaying the spectrogram. It nicely formats the axes to show time and Mel frequency scale information.

With the script modified like this, when you run it, it will not only calculate the embeddings but also visually plot the log-Mel spectrogram of the recorded audio. This can be very useful for analysis and debugging purposes.
