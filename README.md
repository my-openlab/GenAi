The project intent is to use Hyperdimensional vectors to represent and detect wake words. 

This decomposes the problem of detection to simple implementations of logical AND,logical XOR and permutation.

hyperdimensional computing, what is it?

Hyperdimensional computing is an emerging field of research that draws inspiration from theories of high-dimensional spaces in mathematics and physics. In hyperdimensional computing, data is represented and manipulated in high-dimensional vectors rather than traditional binary or numerical formats. This approach leverages the properties of high-dimensional spaces to perform various computational tasks efficiently.

One key concept in hyperdimensional computing is the idea of "binding" or combining information through vector operations in high-dimensional space. This allows for the integration of multiple pieces of information into a single representation, enabling robust and flexible processing.

Hyperdimensional computing has shown promise in various applications, including pattern recognition, machine learning, and cognitive modeling. Its ability to handle noisy and incomplete data, as well as its resistance to certain types of errors, makes it particularly suitable for tasks in environments with high levels of uncertainty or ambiguity.

Overall, hyperdimensional computing represents a novel approach to information processing that may offer significant advantages over traditional computing paradigms in certain domains. However, it is still a relatively young field, and further research is needed to fully understand its capabilities and limitations.

how may this be used for wake word detection in hardware
ChatGPT
1. **Encoding the Audio Input**: The audio signal containing the user's speech needs to be converted into a format suitable for hyperdimensional computing. This could involve encoding the audio signal into a high-dimensional vector representation. Various techniques, such as time-frequency analysis (e.g., Fourier transforms), could be employed to extract features from the audio signal.

2. **Mapping to Hyperdimensional Space**: The extracted features are then mapped into a hyperdimensional space. Each feature or combination of features could correspond to a high-dimensional vector within this space. The properties of high-dimensional spaces, such as the ability to encode rich semantic information, can be leveraged to represent different aspects of the audio signal.

3. **Creating a Wake Word Representation**: A specific wake word, such as "Hey, Assistant," needs to be represented within the hyperdimensional space. This can be done by encoding the wake word into a unique high-dimensional vector. This vector serves as a reference or template for recognizing instances of the wake word.

4. **Detection Algorithm**: During operation, the incoming audio signal is continuously processed and compared with the hyperdimensional representation of the wake word. Various similarity measures or classification techniques can be employed to determine the degree of resemblance between the input signal and the wake word representation.

5. **Thresholding and Decision Making**: A thresholding mechanism is applied to the similarity scores obtained from the comparison process. If the similarity score exceeds a certain threshold, it indicates that the input signal likely contains the wake word. This triggers the activation of subsequent actions or commands within the hardware system.

6. **Adaptation and Learning**: The system may incorporate mechanisms for adaptation and learning, allowing it to improve its wake word detection performance over time. This could involve updating the hyperdimensional representations based on new data and adjusting the detection threshold dynamically.

By leveraging the principles of hyperdimensional computing, wake word detection in hardware systems can potentially achieve efficient and robust performance, even in noisy or variable environments. Additionally, the inherent parallelism of hyperdimensional computing makes it suitable for implementation in hardware architectures optimized for low-power and real-time processing, such as neuromorphic computing platforms.
